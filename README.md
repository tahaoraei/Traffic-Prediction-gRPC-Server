# Welcome to the Traffic Prediction gRPC Server! ðŸš¦

This project brings together the worlds of GoLang and Python to create a powerful gRPC server for real-time traffic prediction. I've trained a LightGBM model in Python, and now it's ready to serve accurate predictions right here in our GoLang-powered server. I've achieved a 5-millisecond latency and can gracefully handle up to 3000 requests per second!


keep in mind that you might need to tweak a few things to match your environment. Feel free to make changes as needed, and if you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, I'd love to hear from you.
